A proper understanding of this projection is therefore intimately related to the representability problem, a long-standing open problem in computational quantum chemistry. Given an orthonormal basis in the finite-dimensional one-particle Hilbert space, we explicitly construct an orthonormal basis of the space of Fock space operators which restricts to an orthonormal basis of the space of k-body operators for all k.},

annote = {{\#} Summary

This paper gives the (probably) first rigorous proof of a theorem of Garrod and
Percus stating that the cone of N -representable p-RDMs is given by an (infinite)
intersection of half spaces. Moreover, it is proved that the closure R k (DM) (in
a suitable topology) coincides with the convex closure of certain extreme points
in R k (DM). Finally, the N -representability problem in infinite dimension is
reduced to the corresponding problem in finite dimensions.

dimensional case?},

@article{Garrod1964,
abstract = {A variational method is presented which is applicable to N‐particle boson or fermion systems with two‐body interactions. For these systems the energy may be expressed in terms of the two‐particle density matrix: $\Gamma$(1, 2 | 1′, 2′)=($\Psi$ |a2+a1+a1′a2′| $\Psi$). In order to have the variational equation: $\delta$E/$\delta$$\Gamma$ = 0 yield the correct ground‐state density matrix one must restrict $\Gamma$ to the set of density matrices which are actually derivable from N‐particle boson (or fermion) systems. Subsidiary conditions are presented which are necessary and sufficient to insure that $\Gamma$ is so derivable. These conditions are of a form which render them unsuited for practical application. However the following necessary (but not sufficient) conditions are shown by some applications to yield good results: It is proven that if $\Gamma$(1, 2 | 1′, 2′) and $\gamma$(1 | 1′) are the two‐particle and one‐particle density matrices of an N‐particle system [normalized by tr $\Gamma$ = N(N − 1) and tr$\gamma$ = N] then the associated operator: G(1,2 | 1′,2′)=$\delta$(1−1′)$\gamma$(2 | 2′)+$\sigma$...},

abstract = {We study the computational complexity of the N-representability problem in quantum chemistry. We show that this problem is QMA-complete, which is the quantum generalization of NP-complete. Our proof uses a simple mapping from spin systems to fermionic systems, as well as a convex optimization technique that reduces the problem of finding ground states to N-representability.},
annote = {This paper shows that computational complexity of the N-representability problem is QMA-complete (i.e. it is in QMA and any problem in QMA can be efficiently reduced to this problem). Coloquially, this means that this problem is intractible even on a quantum computer.

The idea is that the N-representability problem is (computationally) equivalent to the computation of the GSE of 2-local Hamiltonians of spins, which is known (?!) to be QMA-hard. The final step then is to show that the N-representability problem is in QMA, i.e. that there exists an efficient quantum verifier that can check a possible solution of the problem.

Moreover, it is shown that the pure N-representability problem is in QMA(k), which is conjectured to be strictly larger than QMA. It is therefore plausible to assume that the pure N-representability problem is harder than usual N-representability.},

@article{Altunbulak2008,
abstract = {By the Pauli exclusion principle, no quantum state can be occupied by more than one electron. One can state this as a constraint on the one electron density matrix that bounds its eigenvalues by 1. Shortly after its discovery, the Pauli principle was replaced by anti-symmetry of the multi-electron wave function. In this paper we solve a longstanding problem about the impact of this replacement on the one electron density matrix, that goes far beyond the original Pauli principle. Our approach uses Berenstein and Sjamaar's theorem on the restriction of an adjoint orbit onto a subgroup, and allows us to treat any type of permutational symmetry.},
annote = {The Pauli principle, that no quantum state is occupied by more than one electron, is implemented by the anti-symmetry of the many-particle wave function. This, however, imposes additional constraints on the 1-RDM than the original Pauli principle. This work solves the long-standing problem about the impact of this replacement and is based on the Berenstein-Sjamaar theorem, a result in Lie Group theory on adjoint orbits.

Section 5 provides an algorithm for computing complete representability conditions for fixed rank r (i.e. dimension of the 1-particle Hilbert space) and carried out for r {\textless}= 10 in Section 6.

In order to gain some first understanding on the theoretical foundations of this approach, it seems feasible to

1. Understand Examples 1 and 2 of Section 2
2. Gain some basic understanding on the basic notions of theorem 1 (Berenstein-Sjamaar)},
