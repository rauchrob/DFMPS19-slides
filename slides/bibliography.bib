@article{Cances2006,
annote = {The authors consider the 2-RDM formulation of the variational ground state energy problem in quantum chemistry.

They then consider a dual problem, in which the variation occurs over the the dual cone C* of the cone C of 2-RDMs.

An algorithm is presented for solving the dual problem, where C* is replaced by an approximative cone generated by a finite set of (classical) representability conditions. Numerical results for some molecules are presented, which are comparable to Full CI computations.},
