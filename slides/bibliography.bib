abstract = {The reduced k-particle density matrix of a density matrix on finite-dimensional, fermion Fock space can be defined as the image under the orthogonal projection in the Hilbert-Schmidt geometry onto the space of k-body observables. A proper understanding of this projection is therefore intimately related to the representability problem, a long-standing open problem in computational quantum chemistry. Given an orthonormal basis in the finite-dimensional one-particle Hilbert space, we explicitly construct an orthonormal basis of the space of Fock space operators which restricts to an orthonormal basis of the space of k-body operators for all k.},

An algorithm is presented for solving the dual problem, where C* is replaced by an approximative cone generated by a finite set of (classical) representability conditions. Numerical results for some molecules are presented, which are comparable to Full CI computations.},

@article{Kummer1967,
annote = {{\#} Summary

This paper gives the (probably) first rigorous proof of a theorem of Garrod and
Percus stating that the cone of N -representable p-RDMs is given by an (infinite)
intersection of half spaces. Moreover, it is proved that the closure R k (DM) (in
a suitable topology) coincides with the convex closure of certain extreme points
in R k (DM). Finally, the N -representability problem in infinite dimension is
reduced to the corresponding problem in finite dimensions.

{\#} Follow-Up Questions

* In which sense can the infinite-dimensional case be reduced to the finite-
dimensional case?},

@article{Garrod1964,
abstract = {A variational method is presented which is applicable to N‐particle boson or fermion systems with two‐body interactions. For these systems the energy may be expressed in terms of the two‐particle density matrix: $\Gamma$(1, 2 | 1′, 2′)=($\Psi$ |a2+a1+a1′a2′| $\Psi$). In order to have the variational equation: $\delta$E/$\delta$$\Gamma$ = 0 yield the correct ground‐state density matrix one must restrict $\Gamma$ to the set of density matrices which are actually derivable from N‐particle boson (or fermion) systems. Subsidiary conditions are presented which are necessary and sufficient to insure that $\Gamma$ is so derivable. These conditions are of a form which render them unsuited for practical application. However the following necessary (but not sufficient) conditions are shown by some applications to yield good results: It is proven that if $\Gamma$(1, 2 | 1′, 2′) and $\gamma$(1 | 1′) are the two‐particle and one‐particle density matrices of an N‐particle system [normalized by tr $\Gamma$ = N(N − 1) and tr$\gamma$ = N] then the associated operator: G(1,2 | 1′,2′)=$\delta$(1−1′)$\gamma$(2 | 2′)+$\sigma$...},
